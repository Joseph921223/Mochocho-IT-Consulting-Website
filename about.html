						<h2>About Us</h2>
						<P><font color=blue> For a 100% black-owned company that has come Up
              the hard way, <br>there are no free lunches, nor would Jozzler and Lulama Mochocho 
              want any.<br> The exception is when they are the ones providing the lunches 
              and the people eating them are their own employees.</p></font></div>
              <p> 
              "To deliver a good service, our employees need to be in a good state. <br>Because we know
              our employees on a personal level, <br>we know that some people might sometimes come
              to work without eating,<br> so we make sure they all have food," says 
              Lulama,<br> Chief Executive Officer of Mochocho IT consulting.
                </P>
                <p> "Then they can go back to work with energy. <br>
                  We don't ever want our employees working on an empty stomach," says Jozzler,<br>
                       Chief Technology Officer of this Midrand-based IT and telecoms infrastructure company,<br>
                       which opened its doors in 2010 and specialises in providing connectivity in rural <br>
                       and underserved urban areas.</p>
                 
                       <p> it's not just employees' physical wellbeing that is important, Lulama adds.<br>
                       "We realise that frustration and depression are real and we want to make 
                       sure that no employees suffers depression under our watch."
                       </p>
                 
                       <p> This means knowing and caring about what is going on inside and outside 
                       the workplace."We ask after employees's children and we like it when people talk 
                       about their families," says Jozzler. "people are people before they are employees.
                       Sometimes you realise there is something wrong at home that is affecting the 
                       person at work."</p>
                 
                       <p> Taking the human factor into account is only one side of the 
                       people management philosophy at Mochocho's,however. The other side, perhaps 
                       a surprising one for such a small company, is its structured approach to 
                       policies and procedures.</p>
                 
                       <p>Induction is an example. The office manager, who has 
                        HR training ,
                       takes every new employee through an induction programme so 
                       that they understand the company culture, dress code, and workplace
                       etiquette, as well as the various policies that apply to employees</p>
                       
                       <p>"A policy is a roadmap," says Jozzler. "it tells you where to go 
                        what to do and what not to do. A policy speaks for the company.For example,<br>
                         we have an internet policy that explains what to browse on company computers.<br>
                       if somebody browses content that is irrelevant, we show them the internet 
                       policy."</p>
                 
					
					<p> Humanity and structure sit comfortably together in this small company
						that has a heart for employees and a head for business</p>
